Installation: Existing python libraries should be OK for this project to run smoothly

Project motivation: This is to fulfill the requirements of a Udacity project to understand more about how to build a machine learning pipeline

File descriptions: There are only three main py files in this repo: process_data, train_classifier and run

How to interact: Run the process_data.py first to clean and upload data to a database. Then, run the train_classifier.py to train the model and finally run.py to deliver to a web app
